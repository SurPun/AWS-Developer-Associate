# Section 19: AWS Integration & Messaging: SQS, SNS & Kinesis

## 213. Introduction to Messaging

AWS Integration & Messaging (SQS, SNS & Kinesis)

Section Introduction

- When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
- There are two patterns of application communication

1. Synchronous communications (application to application)
 - Buying Service <-> Shipping Service

2. Asynchronous / Event based (application to queue to application)
 - Buying Service -> Queue -> Shipping Service

Section Introduction

- Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
- What if you need to suddenly encode !000 videos but usually it’s 10?
- In that case, it's better to decouple your applications,
 - using SQS: queue model
 - using SNS: pub/sub model
 - using Kinesis: real-time streaming model
- These services can scale independently from our application!

## 214. Amazon SQS - Standard Queues

Amazon SQS — Standard Queue

- Oldest offering (over 10 years old)
- Fully managed service, used to decouple applications

- Attributes:
 - Unlimited throughput, unlimited number of messages in queue
 - Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
 - Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive)
 - Limitation of 256KB per message sent

- Can have duplicate messages (at least once delivery, occasionally)
- Can have out of order messages (best effort ordering)

SQS — Producing Messages

- Produced to SQS using the SDK (SendMessage API)
- The message is persisted in SQS until a consumer deletes it
- Message retention: default 4 days, up to 14 days

- Example: send an order to be processed
 - Order id
 - Customer id
 - Any attributes you want

- SOS standard: unlimited throughput

SQS — Consuming Messages

- Consumers (running on EC2 instances, servers, or AWS Lambda)...
- Poll SQS for messages (receive up to 10 messages at a time)
- Process the messages (example: insert the message into an RDS database)
- Delete the messages using the DeleteMessage API

SQS — Multiple EC2 Instances Consumers

- Consumers receive and process messages in parallel
- At least once delivery
- Best-effort message ordering
- Consumers delete messages after processing them
- We can scale consumers horizontally to improve throughput of processing

Amazon SQS - Security

- Encryption:
 - In-flight encryption using HTTPS API
 - At-rest encryption using KMS keys
 - Client-side encryption if the client wants to perform encryption decryption itself

- Access Controls: IAM policies to regulate access to the SQS API

- SQS Access Policies (similar to $3 bucket policies)
 - Useful for cross-account access to SQS queues
 - Useful for allowing other services (SNS, S3...) to write to an SQS queue

## 216. SQS Queue Access Policy

SQS Queue Access Policy

- Cross Account Access

- Publish S3 Event Notifications to SQS Queue
