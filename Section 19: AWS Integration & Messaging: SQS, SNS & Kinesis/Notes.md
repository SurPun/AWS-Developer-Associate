# Section 19: AWS Integration & Messaging: SQS, SNS & Kinesis

## 213. Introduction to Messaging

AWS Integration & Messaging (SQS, SNS & Kinesis)

Section Introduction

- When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
- There are two patterns of application communication

1. Synchronous communications (application to application)
 - Buying Service <-> Shipping Service

2. Asynchronous / Event based (application to queue to application)
 - Buying Service -> Queue -> Shipping Service

Section Introduction

- Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
- What if you need to suddenly encode !000 videos but usually itâ€™s 10?
- In that case, it's better to decouple your applications,
 - using SQS: queue model
 - using SNS: pub/sub model
 - using Kinesis: real-time streaming model
- These services can scale independently from our application!
