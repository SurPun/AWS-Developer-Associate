# Section 11: Amazon S3 Introduction

## 113. S3 Overview

Section introduction

- Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
- It's advertised as "infinitely scaling” storage

- Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
- Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well

- We'll have a step-by-step approach to S3

Amazon S3 Use cases

- Backup and storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website

Amazon S3 - Buckets

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention
  - No uppercase, No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number
  - Must NOT start with the prefix xn—
  - Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias

 Amazon S3 - Objects

- Objects (files) have a Key
- The key is the FULL path:
  - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder my_file.txt
- The key is composed of prefix + object name
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
- There's no concept of “directories” within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (‘‘/’’)

Amazon S3 — Objects (cont.)

- Object values are the content of the body:
  - Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”

- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs — system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key / value pair — up to 10) — useful for security / lifecycle
* Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

## 115. S3 Security: Bucket Policy

Amazon S3 — Security

- User-Based
  - IAM Policies — which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM

- Resource-Based
  - Bucket Policies — bucket wide rules from the $3 console - allows cross account
  - Object Access Control List (ACL) — finer grain (can be disabled)
  - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) — less common (can be disabled)

- Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
  - The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
  - AND there's no explicit DENY

- Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

S3 Bucket Policies

- JSON based policies
  - Resources: buckets and objects
  - Effect: Allow / Deny
  - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
  - Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to

- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  - Grant public access to the bucket
  - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  - Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

## 117. S3 Website Overview

Amazon S3 — Static Website Hosting

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet

- The website URL will be (depending on the region)
  - http://bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazonaws.com
   OR
  - http://bucket-name.s3-website.aws-region.amazonaws.com

- If you get a 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!

## 119. S3 Versioning

Amazon S3 - Versioning

- You can version your files in Amazon $3
- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will change the “version”: 1, 2, 3....
- It is best practice to version your buckets
  - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  - Easy roll back to previous version

- Notes:
  - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
  - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

## 121. S3 Replication

Amazon S3 — Replication (CRR & SRR)

- Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
- Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- Same-Region Replication (SRR)
- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3

- Use cases:
  - CRR— compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
  - SRR — log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

## 122. S3 Replication Notes

Amazon S3 — Replication (Notes)

- After you enable Replication, only new objects are replicated
- Optionally, you can replicate existing objects using $3 Batch Replication
- Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication

- For DELETE operations
  - Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting)
  - Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes)

- There is no “chaining” of replication
  - If bucket | has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3
  - Then objects created in bucket | are not replicated to bucket 3
