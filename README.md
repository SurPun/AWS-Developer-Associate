# Preparing for the Exam

Practice makes perfect

- If you're new to AWS, take a bit of AWS practice thanks to this course before rushing to the exam
- The exam recommends you to have one or more years of hands-on developing and maintaining an AWS based applications
- Practice makes perfect!
- If you feel overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge you just learned, just go through it one more time

Ideas for practicing. ..!

- Take one of your existing applications
- Try deploying it manually on EC2
- Try deploying it on Elastic Beanstalk and have it scale
- Try creating a CICD pipeline for it
- Try decoupling components using SQS / SNS
- If possible, try running it on AWS Lambda & friends
- Write automation scripts using the CLI / SDK
    - Idea 1: Shut down EC2 instances at night / start in the morning
    - Idea 2: Automate snapshots of EBS volumes at night
    - Idea 3: List all under-utilized EC2 instances (CPU Utilization < 10%)

Proceed by elimination

- Most questions are going to be scenario based
- For all the questions, rule out answers that you know for sure are wrong
- For the remaining answers, understand which one makes the most sense
