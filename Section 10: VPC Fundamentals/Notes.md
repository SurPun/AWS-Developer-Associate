# Section 10: VOC Fundamentals

## 107. VPC, Subnets, IGW and NAT

VPC & Subnets Primer

- VPC: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)
- Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)
- A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
- A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
- To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.

Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways

- Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
- Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
- NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private
