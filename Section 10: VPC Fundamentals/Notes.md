# Section 10: VOC Fundamentals

## 108. VPC, Subnets, IGW and NAT

VPC & Subnets Primer

- VPC: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)
- Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)
- A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
- A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
- To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.

Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways

- Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
- Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
- NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private

## 109. NACL, SG, VPC Flow Logs

Network ACL & Security Groups

- NACL (Network ACL)
    - A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
    - Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
    - Are attached at the Subnet level
    - Rules only include IP addresses

- Security Groups
    - A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance
    - Can have only ALLOW rules
    - Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

VPC Flow Logs

- Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
    - VPC Flow Logs
    - Subnet Flow Logs
    - Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs

- Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example:
    - Subnets to internet
    - Subnets to subnets
    - Internet to subnets

- Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc...
- VPC Flow logs data can go to $3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehose

## 110. VPC Peering, Endpoints VPC, DX

VPC Peering

- Connect two VPC, privately using AWSâ€™ network
- Make them behave as if they were in the same network
- Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
- VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

VPC Endpoints

- Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
-  This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
- VPC Endpoint Gateway: $3 & DynamoDB 
- VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest

- Only used within your VPC

Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect

- Site to Site VPN
    - Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS
    - The connection is automatically encrypted
    - Goes over the public internet

- Direct Connect (DX)
    - Establish a physical connection between on- premises and AWS
    - The connection is private, secure and fast
    - Goes over a private network
    - Takes at least a month to establish
